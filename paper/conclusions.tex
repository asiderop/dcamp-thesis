This work presents \dcampns: Distributed Common API for Measuring Performance, a distributed performance framework built
on top of Mark Gabel and Michael Haungs' \camp \cite{gabel2007}. This work describes the design and implementation of
\dcampns, using roles and services on top of ZeroMQ to build a simple, reliable distributed system.

A set of criterion for evaluating distributed performance frameworks is also given by extending and updating the
criterion presented in \cite{zanikolas2005}. This criterion is then used to evaluate \dcamp along with several other
related works.

\section{Summary of Contributions}

\dcamp itself extends \camp with (1) a stateful performance measurement API, (2) distribution and aggregation of
performance metrics, (3) filtering and triggering of performance metrics across the distributed system, and (4) simple
fault tolerance to recover from node failures.

The updated distributed performance framework criterion is introduced and used to evaluate \dcampns. Chapter
\ref{analysis} presents an empirical evaluation of \dcampns's transparency and scalability. Validity and portability are
inherited from \camp as well as the use of portable Python libraries. \dcampns's data delivery models and completeness
are apparent in the system's design and configuration.

Updating \dcamp to meet the security criterion is unfinished work as described in the next section along with the rest
of \dcampns's future directions.
