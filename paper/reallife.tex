\chapter{Real Life}
\label{get_it_done}

Finishing a master's thesis after college is no joke.
Get it done now. Seriously.
Do not waste your time.
Real life is full of real work. Real deadlines.
Relationships. Marriage. Babies. Nothing slows down.

Life is not waiting for you to complete unfinished work.
There will be a tinge of guilt with every new project and every day spent not working towards its completion.
Goodwill runs out; good intentions are just false promises.

Plus, a degree is a nice thing to have, if not now, at least at some point in the future.
