\chapter{Real Life}
\label{get_it_done}

Finishing a master's thesis after college is no joke.
Get it done now. 
Do not waste your time.
Real life is full of real work. Marriage. Babies.

Life is not waiting for you to complete unfinished tasks.
There will be a tinge of guilt with every new project and every day spent not working towards completion of the thesis.
Goodwill runs out; good intentions are just false promises.

Also, a degree is a nice thing to have, if not now, at least at some point in the future.
