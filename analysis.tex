To verify that \dcamp meets the distributed performance framework criterion outlined in \ref{introduction}, several experiments were run on a test installation of \dcamp in a test environment. The goal of these experiments was two fold: verify \dcamp's functionality as well as determine the thresholds for several key configuration parameters. For \dcamp to scale, it is important for the number of child nodes per parent to be limited to a reasonable number. These experiments help to define ``reasonable'' for various scenarios, environments, and performance monitoring requirements.
