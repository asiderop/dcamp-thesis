\begin{itemize}

\item uniform configuration: The configuration of the entire system is uniform, i.e., all branches of the system will be
collecting the same data at each level in the hierarchy---it is not possible to have different data being collected by
different branches.

\item network failure: \dcamp does not support any fault tolerance for network failures; \dcamp only attempts to recover
from node failures. It is assumed that if (part of) the network goes down, the lack of data from that subnet will
suffice

\item time accuracy: The system time among multiple nodes in the system may vary significantly; \dcamp is not meant to
be a high-resolution system with respect to the order of performance data occurrences. It is assumed that the ordering
of performance events in the system is insignificant and timestamps associated with performance data are rough
estimates.

\end{itemize}
