\section{Configuration}

\subsection{Node Specification}

Nodes may be specified individually (DNS-resolvable name or IP Address) or as groups (IP subnet). Additionally, nodes
may be included or excluded based on DNS name or IP Address matching. Name matching does a case-insensitive comparison
of the node's DNS name; left, right, or whole name matching can be specified. Address matching checks that the node's IP
Address falls within a given subnet (i.e. IP Address and mask length).

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \begin{lstlisting}
    node-spec        = node / node-group
    node             = address ":" port
    address          = hostname / ip-address
    node-group       = group-name 1*( node / subnet ) *filter
    subnet           = ip-address "/" mask-length
    filter           = [ "+" / "-" ] ( hostname-match / subnet-match )
    hostname-match   = [ ( "L" / "R" / "W" ) SP ] partial-hostname
    subnet-match     = subnet
    \end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Sample Specification}

Performance metric samples are specified as:

\begin{enumerate}
\item the node(s) on which to sample the data,
\item the rate at which data should be sampled,
\item the threshold past which data should be reported, and lastly
\item the actual performance metric to be sampled.
\end{enumerate}

The report threshold can be specified as "hold and report every N seconds" or "report when the metric value is
greater/less than X". When "hold" is specified (via an *), all metric values sampled during the time limit are sent.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \begin{lstlisting}
    sample-spec      = 1*sample
    sample           = sample-rate [ report-threshold ] metric
    sample-rate      = 1*DIGIT "s" ; seconds
    report-threshold = ( "*" 1*DIGIT "s" ) / ( ( "<" / ">" ) 1*DIGIT ) ; seconds or raw value
    metric           = "CPU" / "DISK" / "NETWORK"
    \end{lstlisting}
